Trello RTL Support
===============

Hi :) <br>
After a long time that I disappointed of rtl-support feature on [Trello](https://trello.com) I decided to figure a solution out! <br>

There is some screenshots, so you can see the result :) <br><br>

- Cards list: <br>

- Typing in RTL: <br>

- Check list RTL/LTR: <br>

So if you are a trello fan and working with it and you have some RTL content in your boards data, I suggest this solution to you. I hope you enjoy it :)<br>

<h2>Languages Support:</h2>
1- Persian <br>
2- Arabic <br>
3- Hebrew <br>

<h2>How to use</h2>
<b>Method 1 (Recommended):</b> <br>
1. Install [cjs chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija) to run javascript code. (script.js in this case) <br>
2. Go to [Trello Home Page](https://trello.com) <br>
3. Add content of [script.js](https://github.com/ykh/trello-auto-dir/blob/master/script.js) to cjs extension <br>
4. And... enjoying Trello more than before :) <br>
<b>Method 2:</b> <br>
1. Download and install [TamperMonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) Extensions <br>
2. After that you can install script.js via [Monkeyguts](https://monkeyguts.com/code.php?id=657) <br>
3. Enable script, and have fun :) <br>

<h2>Just to remind</h2>
- [cjs-extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija) is just a tool to run custome javascript in any website you want, so you can use another tool to run the script.js :)<br>
- script.js is written to be use on [Trello](https://trello.com).
- script.js never ever any effects on your trello boards data, it just effect on styles.
- If you need another rtl-language that not exists in supported list, send me your language name, and I will trying to add it :)
