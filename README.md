Trello RTL Support
===============

<b>[DEPRECATED! but Don't Worry, I Have a Surprise]</b> </br>
I Just Migrated to [rtl-happy](https://github.com/ykh/rtl-happy) repository, it's same as this repo with some new advantages: </br>
- You Can Use RTL-Happy Script as a Chrome Extension! :)
- You Can Use It as a User-Script same as always.
- You Can Use It as an Script in Your Own Way(s)!
- [Phabricator](https://phacility.com/) Is Supported Right Now.

HAVE FUN :)

Hi :) <br>
After a long time that I disappointed of rtl-support feature on [Trello](https://trello.com) I decided to figure a solution out! <br>

There is some screenshots, so you can see the result :) <br><br>

- Cards list: <br>

So if you are a trello fan and working with it and you have some RTL content in your boards data, I suggest this solution to you. I hope you enjoy it :)<br>

2. Go to [Trello Home Page](https://trello.com) <br>

<h2>Add more readability</h2>
<b>More useful for Windows users</b> <br>

<h2>Just to remind</h2>
- [cjs-extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija) is just a tool to run custome javascript in any website you want, so you can use another tool to run the script.js :)<br>
- script.js is written to be use on [Trello](https://trello.com).
- script.js never ever any effects on your trello boards data, it just effect on styles.
- If you need another rtl-language that not exists in supported list, send me your language name, and I will trying to add it :)
